💖 Date Me — Yes or Yes?

A cute and funny love proposal webpage where saying “No” isn’t really an option — the button keeps running away! The only answer is “Yes” ❤️

This playful little project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it’s designed to bring a smile (and hopefully a yes) from that special someone.

✨ Features

A simple, romantic, and funny interface.

Interactive Yes/No buttons with a twist.

The No button never stays in place 👀.

Responsive and shareable as a webpage.

🚀 How to Use

Clone or download this repo.

Open index.html in your browser.

Ask your special someone to try it.

Enjoy their reaction when they can’t say no! 🥰

💡 Inspiration

This project is made purely for fun — a lighthearted way of making a love proposal with a touch of humor and cuteness.
